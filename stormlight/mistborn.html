      Mistborn is an epic fantasy trilogy and a heist story of political
      intrigue, surprises and magical martial-arts action. The saga dares to
      turn a genre on its head by asking a simple question: What if the hero of
      prophecy fails? What kind of world results when the Dark Lord is in
      charge?
