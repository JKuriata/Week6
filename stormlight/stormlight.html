      Brandon Sanderson's epic fantasy cycle tells the story of Roshar, a world
      of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the
      rocky terrain. It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated
      orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate
      remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men
      into near-invincible warriors. As brutal wars rage over the control of
      these magical weapons, an ancient text called The Way of Kings tells of
      ancient times, the Knights Radiant, and perhaps the true cause of the war.
      The Knights Radiant must stand again.
